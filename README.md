# Calorie-tracker
This calorie tracker is my first independent project. Inspired by my struggles to manage calorie intake, I created a simple solution similar to a budget app I used for saving money. Users can set daily calorie and protein goals, categorize food entries, and receive feedback on remaining intake. It's a practical step into building Java applications.
